text,Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,"More volcanoes dump more CO2 into the atmosphere.  Because the carbon sinks take a long time to react (~100,000 years), CO2 sources exceed CO2 sinks, causing the atmospheric CO2 level to rise.  ","An increase in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario.  We allow it to move from level 1 to level 2 in 100-200 years.  In almost all real cases, it will actually take a much longer time to change. ",,Rising temperatures will melt ice.,"Rising temperature raises sea level quickly (due to thermal expansion--which changed sea level in this scenario). Melting glacial ice and volcanic activity also raise sea level, but response times are longer.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.  However, it will take >200 years to respond.","Rising weathering rates increase carbonate deposition (more C and Ca are washed to the oceans), but response times are long (~100,000 years)","C burial by sediments, buried C release, Insolation, and Mountains likely won't change enough to have an effect in this scenario.",,

text,Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,"In 100,000 years, CO2 levels have increased since the volcanic source has increased and the C sinks are just beginning to respond at this time scale. ","An increase in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario.  It rises from very low (level 1) to medium (level 3) in 100,000 years.  This is a very rapid change in volcanism.",,"Rising temperatures will melt a significant part of this planet's ice during this 100,000 year period.","Rising temperature raises sea level quickly (but didn't play much of a role during this time period). Melting glacial ice and volcanic activity (if due to higher mid-ocean ridge activity) also raise sea level, and will do so during this time scale.  These two processes caused most of the change during this time interval.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.  ","Rising weathering rates increase carbonate deposition, which responses in ~100,000 years.",,,

text,"Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.    Since CO2 level has now reached a maximum, so will the planet's temperature.","During this time interval, C removal (carbonate deposition) catches up to the increased C source.","An increase in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario.  In this scenario, volcanism reaches its maximum level (5) and will stay constant for the rest of the simulation.",,"All of the planet's ice melted during this period.  Because all the ice melted, the planet's albedo is as low as it can get.  As a result, the planet's temperature remains high, even when CO2 levels begin to slowly drop.","Sea level reaches its maximum height due to the high temperatures, high volcanic rate, and no polar ice.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.  Weathering rate tops out during this time scale.  ",Weathering is now providing the maximum amount of raw materials to make carbonate (given the low level of mountains).  Carbonate deposition is now maximized.  ,,,

","During this time interval, C removal (due to carbonate deposition) surpasses the volcanic source rate of CO2.  The CO2 level remains high, but begins to slowly decrease, coming down a level over several million years. ",,,"Even though temperature declined over this time period, the planet remains ice free, primarily because of the ice-albedo feedback cycle.","Even though the planet remains ice-free, sea level comes down.  This is primarily due to the decrease in temperature.  As the planet cools, ocean water takes up less volume, causing a drop in sea level.",,"Cooling temperature lowers evaporation and precipitation, which decreases weathering rates.",Dropping weathering rates decreases carbonate deposition as less C and Ca are washed to the oceans.,,,
