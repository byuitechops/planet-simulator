text,"  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 remained constant, so did temperature.","In this short time scale, carbon sources and sinks are still in equilibrium, thus, atmopsheric CO2 level remains constant.","In this scenario, volcanoes, mountains, and insolation remain constannt.  Carbon burial by sedimentation and Buried Carbon Release due to weathering will likely not change enough to change levels.",,"Because temperatures remained constant, so did ice level.","Sea level changes due to changes in sea water temperature, volcanic activity (increased mid-ocean ridge activity), and ice level.  These all remained constant during this short time scale.",,"In this scenario, the weathering rate decreases (for an unspecified reason).  In reality, weathering rate will change because of several physical processes (rainfall amount, amount of igneous rock exposed at the planet's surface, CO2 level, extent of glaciers, etc).  Although this is a long time scale process (certainly longer than 200 years), it is shown to indicate that the process is underway.","Decreased weathering rates decrease carbonate deposition less C and Ca are washed to the oceans), but response times are long (~100,000 years)",,,

Since CO2 rose, so did temperature.",Lowering the sinks of CO2 without changing the sources causes atmospheric CO2 levels to increase.,,,"As temperatures rise, ice melts, lowering ice level.","Sea level rises due to increased global temperature (thermal expansion) and melting ice.  Since volcanoes remained constant, they don't affect sea level.",,Weathering decreases to medium during this time scale (again for unspecified reasons).,"Decreased weathering rates decrease carbonate deposition less C and Ca are washed to the oceans).  This process operates in this time scale, lowering CO2 sinks.",,,
